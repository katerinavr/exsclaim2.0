widely used for bioelectronics is the organic 
electrochemical 
transistors 
(OECTs), 
which offer the advantages of low opera-
tion voltage (<1 V), high sensitivity, and 
excellent aqueous operating capability.[7–9] 
In particular, the high sensitivity originates 
from the amplification of the input voltage 
to current through the bulk doping effect 
of the conjugated polymers from an ionic 
source (for example, aqueous electrolyte). 
The past few years have seen advances in 
new materials development, mixed ionic/
electronic transport understanding, and 
individual 
high 
performing 
p-/n-type 
OECT demonstrations.[10–15] The push for 
OECT-based complementary metal–oxide–
semiconductor (CMOS) logic configura-
tion is driven by the desire for devices with 
lower power consumption and smaller 
physical layout as compared with the uni-
polar p-type or n-type circuit configura-
tions.[3,16] The use of individual p-type and 
n-type OECTs to form CMOS inverters has 
attained gain values of up to 100 V V−1, 
mainly through the engineering of the channel dimensions 
and thickness to improve the imbalance between the electron 
and hole currents.[17–19] In these CMOS inverters, the p-type 
polymers can be poly(3,4-ethylene-dioxythiophene):polystyrene 
sulfonate (PEDOT:PSS),[17] conjugated polymers with glycolated 
side chains to facilitate ion transports like p(g42T-T),[16,19] conju-
gated polyelectrolyte poly(3-carboxypentylthiophene) (P3CPT),[11] 
The rapid development of organic electrochemical transistor (OECTs)-based 
circuits brings new opportunities for next-generation integrated bioelec-
tronics. The all-polymer bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) offers an attractive, 
inexpensive alternative to achieve efficient ambipolar OECTs, and building 
blocks of logic circuits constructed from them, but have not been investigated 
to date. Here, the first all-polymer BHJ-based OECTs are reported, consisting 
of a blend of new p-type ladder conjugated polymer and a state-of-the-art 
n-type ladder polymer. The whole ladder-type polymer BHJ also proves that 
side chains are not necessary for good ion transport. Instead, the polymer 
nanostructures play a critical role in the ion penetration and transportation 
and thus in the device performance. It also provides a facile strategy and 
simplifies the fabrication process, forgoing the need to pattern multiple active 
layers. In addition, the development of complementary metal–oxide–semi-
conductor (CMOS)-like OECTs allows the pursuit of advanced functional 
logic circuitry, including inverters and NAND gates, as well as for amplifying 
electrophysiology signals. This work opens a new approach to the design of 
new materials for OECTs and will contribute to the development of organic 
heterojunctions for ambipolar OECTs toward high-performing logic circuits.

while the n-type polymer used is only based on ladder-type pol
y(benzimidazobenzophenanthrolinedione) (BBL), which is cur-
rently the best performing n-type OECT.[19,20] It was also found 
that the lack of side chains does not affect the BBL-based OECT 
peformance and possesses great stability due to the negligible 
swelling behavior.[20] Although the complementary logic circuit 
based on these individual p-type and n-type based OECTs exhibit 
good performance, the manufacturing process is more complex 
with the need to micropattern p- and n-channels separately.
Ambipolar behavior that can provide both n- and p-channel 
performance in a single device is therefore very important for 
lower-cost, monolithic manufacturing of CMOS integrated  
circuits.[18,21,22] This has led to the search for novel ambipolar 
conjugated polymers for OECT-based circuits. One of the first 
polymers employed in ambipolar OECTs contains diketopyr-
rolopyrrole structure and showed balanced hole and elec-
tron transport. However, the transient speed is rather slow  
(≈1.8 s).[22] While such response speeds may be sufficient for 
limited sensing applications, they are insufficient for advanced 
integrated bioelectronics such as electrooculography (EOG), 
electrocardiogram (ECG), and other in vitro electrophysiolog-
ical monitoring. The other challenge hampering the practical 
applications of ambipolar inverters lies in the relatively high 
threshold voltage (VT > 0.8 V), which leads to the requirement 
of a high drain bias (VDD) value for a high voltage gain (e.g., 
a maximum gain value of 50 at VDD  = 1.4 V,[22] or only 12 at  
VDD  = 0.8 V).[21] A high bias voltage makes the operational 
stability of the devices in aqueous environments a challenge.  
The stability of the ambipolar OECT devices is limited so far, 
where the performance of either p-type, n-type, or both can 
degrade during continuous operation. The energy levels of 
the ambipolar OECT materials need to be carefully tailored to 
avoid side reactions with water and oxygen and to suppress self-
doping behavior, and thus ensuring the long-term stability of 
the doped states in aqueous environment.[21,22] Encapsulation 
of the devices or removal of dissolved oxygen from electrolytes 
is often required to improve the operational stability. Although 
synthesizing novel ambipolar conjugated polymers has proven 
to be an effective avenue for the design of ambipolar logic 
circuits, it is still challenging in combining their respective 
advanced features (including fast transient speed, low VT, high 
voltage gain, ambipolar inverter behaviors, stability, etc.) into a 
single system to date. More recently, by engineering the device 
configuration, an ambipolar inverter based on cofacial vertical 
OECT pairs showed a voltage gain of 28 (at VDD = 0.8 V) and 
has been successfully used as an analog voltage preamplifier for 
recording electrocardiogram signals.[18] Although the approach 
of using cofacial vertical OECT pairs holds promise for the 
development of high-gain inverters, the ambipolar behavior is 
still governed by the developed ambipolar conjugated polymers.
Another promising way to achieve ambipolar transportation 
is by controlling the mixing and phase separation of two active 
semiconductor components: one electron transporting and the 
other hole transporting. Such mixing of donor and acceptor 
materials is akin to those commonly employed in organic solar 
cells, typically called organic bulk heterojunctions (BHJs).[23–26]  
However, the concept of BHJ is yet to be implemented in 
OECTs for the tuning of the p- and n-type phases and hence 
balanced hole and electron transport. This is most probably 
due to the solvent compatibility issues as well as the scarcity 
of high-performing and soluble n-type polymers, where most 
p-type polymers for OECTs are dissolved in polar solvents while 
the current state-of-the-art BBL polymer employs acid-based 
solvents.
Here, we report for the first time, polymer BHJ based OECTs 
that can be doped by both cations and anions, consisting of a blend 
of a new p-type 6H-pyrrolo[3,2-b:4,5-b’]bis[1,4]benzothiazine  
ladder (PBBTL) polymer, and the state-of-the-art n-type BBL. 
Furthermore, the new p-type PBBTL is the first reported ladder-
type conjugated polymer (without any side chains) that still 
possesses good electronic/ionic transport for OECTs, with µC* 
value of 4.82 ± 1.63 F cm−1 V−1 s−1. The BHJ is implemented 
by solution casting the all-polymer PBBTL:BBL blend, resulting 
in a bicontinuous network of homogeneously distributed junc-
tions between the PBBTL and BBL interfaces. The tuning of the 
p-type and n-type phases in the BHJ allows the development 
of OECTs with good ambipolar properties, attaining balanced 
µC* values 2.72 ± 1.04 and 1.36 ± 0.81 F cm−1 V−1 s−1 for p-type 
and n-type operation, respectively. In these p/n-channel semi-
conducting BHJs, the hole and electron current are balanced 
for the pull-down and pull-up channels, while having relatively 
low VT. Thanks to the ambipolar feature of BHJ OECTs, the 
developed ambipolar inverter is able to process three bits of 
information (i.e., 0, +1, and −1), yielding high voltage gain value 
of 42 V V−1 (at VDD = −0.6 V) and 31 V V−1 (at VDD = 0.6 V).  
The obtained good ambipolar BHJ device performance is 
attributed to their porous fibrillar network which allows rapid 
penetration and transport of both the cations and anions in 
the bulk channel. As a result of the porous fibrillar network, 
the optimized BHJ OECTs showed good transient speeds of  
3.05 ms and 1.72 ms as p-type and n-type channel, respectively. 
The use of this BHJ OECTs complementary inverter to amplify 
electrooculography (EOG) signals is also demonstrated. Our 
work, therefore, presents a new potential route for the design 
of mixed ionic–electronic conducting polymers, and provides a 
facile strategy to develop all-polymer BHJ OECTs with balanced 
electron and hole transport, and ultimately achieve high ampli-
fication and easy scaling for integrated circuits.
2. Results and Discussion
2.1. New p-Type Ladder Conjugated Polymer for OECTs
The synthetic route of PBBTL (Figure 1a) followed a previous 
work.[27] Cyclic voltammetry (CV) was performed to understand 
the electrochemical redox reactions of PBBTL in 0.1 m aqueous 
NaCl solution, as presented in Figure S1a (Supporting Informa-
tion), yielding an oxidation onset potential of +0.35 V vs Ag/AgCl  
electrode. The optical properties of this ladder PBBTL polymer 
were characterized by UV–vis absorption measurements, 
showing strong absorption range from 300–750 nm with 
three characteristic peaks at 445, 675, and 748 nm respectively  
(Figure S1b, Supporting Information). The highest occupied 
molecular orbital (HOMO) energy level is determined to be 
relatively deep (−5.21 eV, Figure S2, Supporting Information) 
which might: i) prevent the occurrence of non-capacitive fara-
daic side-reaction in oxygen-containing aqueous electrolyte

and thus improving the electrochemical redox stability of the 
polymer,[22,27,28] and ii) avoid the self-doping behavior,[28] there-
fore enabling accumulation mode in the OECT (achieving OFF 
state in the absence of gate bias).
Figure  1b presents the device configuration of a PBBTL-
based OECT, in which the PBBTL polymer was in contact with 
the source/drain electrodes and in direct exposure to 0.1 m  
NaCl electrolyte. An Ag/AgCl gate electrode was immersed 
into the electrolyte to modulate the ions in or out of the bulk 
channel and thus electrochemical doping of PBBTL channel. 
Specifically, upon application of a negative gate bias (VG), the 
Cl− anions from the electrolyte were injected into the PBBTL 
channel, starting the electrochemical doping process, allowing 
hole accumulation in the bulk channel and hence increased 
drain current (Figure  1c and Figure S3, Supporting Informa-
tion). The obtained PBBTL device shows a threshold voltage 
(VT) of −0.41 V (Figure S4a, Supporting Information) and a high 
drain current ON/OFF ratio of ≈105 (Figure S4b, Supporting 
Information). It is worth noting that this PBBTL channel was 
completely OFF at VG = 0 V, enabling the device to be operated 
in accumulation mode, most probably attributed to the rela-
tively deep HOMO energy level and in good agreement with 
the positive onset voltage observed by CV (Figure S1a, Sup-
porting Information).

where ID and VG are the drain current and gate bias, respec-
tively, W, d, and L are the channel width, thickness, and length, 
respectively, µ is the carrier mobility, and C* is the volumetric 
capacitance. As shown in Figure  1d, a peak transconductance 
gm of 148 µS was obtained, and the normalized gm (normal-
ized by the channel dimension of dW/L) is 0.58 ± 0.17 S cm−1. 
Negligible hysteresis was seen in both transfer and output 
characteristics, indicating good ion penetration and transport 
efficiency into or out of the bulk channel. The ionic–electronic 
properties of the PBBTL were next evaluated by the product 
of µC*,[29] yielding a µC* value of 4.82 ± 1.63 F cm−1 V−1 s−1 
(averaged from more than 12 devices with different channel 
geometries, see Figure 1e, Figure S5a and Table S1, Supporting 
Information). An obvious enhancement in the transconduct-
ance when the channel geometry was increased through the

tuning of the channel thickness (d) was observed, clearly indi-
cating the volumetric doping processes in this PBBTL channel 
(Figure S5b, Supporting Information). As detailed in Table S1  
(Supporting Information), the PBBTL-based OECTs show 
modest normalized gm and µC* values when compared to the 
reported accumulation mode OECTs.[12,15,19,28,30–35] However, 
it displayed a fast transient response with τON  = 2.7 ms and 
τOFF  = 1.1 ms (Figure  1f), even when the polymer structure 
lacks any glycolated side chains, which is 103 times faster than 
the other hydrophobic conjugated polymers based OECT (like 
poly[2,5-bis(3-tetradecylthiophen-2-yl) 
thieno[3,2-b]thiophene]  
and poly(3-(methoxyethoxybutyl)thiophene)),[36,37] around 10 times  
faster than some of the ethylene glycol (EG)-functionalized conju-
gated polymers (such as PIBET-AO/PIBET-O based devices),[33] 
while comparable to the state-of-the-art p(g2T-TT) and 
p(gPyDPP-MeOT2) polymers (Table S1, Supporting Informa-
tion).[12,15,28,30] Overall, it is noteworthy that this new ladder-type  
material (PBBTL) exhibits both encouragingly good ionic and 
electronic conducting properties, even in the absence of glyco-
lated side chains.
In situ UV–vis spectrum measurement was employed to 
gain insight into the electrochemical doping-dedoping mecha-
nisms for this new ladder-type polymer. The evolution in the 
absorption spectra directly reflects the changes in its electronic 
band structure and thus the electrochemical doping efficiency. 
Upon progressive increment of the bias (from 0 to 0.8 V, at 
a step of 0.025 V) (Figure S6, Supporting Information), the  
Cl− anions from the electrolyte were injected into the PBBTL 
film, leading to the gradual disappearance of the transition 
peaks centered at 445, 675, and 748 nm while one new absorp-
tion features beyond 800 nm (ascribed to polaron transition) 
emerged. The change in the absorption characteristics indicates 
that the PBBTL film was electrochemically doped by the injected 
ions and switched from neutral to oxidized state (PBBTL+) and 
underwent charge accumulation. Electrochemical impedance 
spectroscopy (EIS) was next employed to extract the C* which 
indicates the efficiency of ion penetration from the electrolyte 
into the active channel. As shown in Figure 1g and Figure S7 
(Supporting Information), a high C* value of 143 F cm−3 was 
attained. The holes mobility was extracted using equation (1), 
yielding a value of 0.034 ± 0.014 cm2 V−1 s−1. Additionally, we 
found that the PBBTL polymer shows a good reversible elec-
trochemical redox process in aqueous environment, where no 
significant drain current degradation was observed after 5000 
cycles of pulse measurement (Figure 1h).
2.2. Bulk-Heterojunction OECTs Ambipolar Operation
The all-polymer donor–acceptor heterojunction, consisting of 
the new p-type ladder polymer (PBBTL) and an n-type ladder con-
jugated polymer (BBL) (Figure 2a), was prepared by dissolving 
PBBTL and BBL in methanesulfonic acid (MSA), at different 
mass ratios (see details in experimental section). BBL is currently 
the best performing n-type OECT polymer, exhibiting good 
n-type performance and excellent stability (Figures S8 and S9,  
Supporting Information). The extracted HOMO for p-type PBBTL 
and LUMO for n-type BBL are −5.21 eV and −4.30 eV (Figure 2b-c 
and Figure S10, Supporting Information), respectively, which  
is reasonable for this BHJ material to achieve ambipolarity with 
the ability to avoid side reactions with water and oxygen and 
self-doping behavior.[28] The CV measurements of PBBTL:BBL 
hybrid film in 0.1 m aqueous NaCl solution (Figure 2d) also pre-
sent ambipolar features with good stability during 20 charging 
and discharging cycles, indicative of reversible electrochemical 
redox reactions in aqueous environment.
X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was employed to verify 
the presence and distribution of both PBBTL and BBL phases 
in the bulk film. For the blend PBBTL:BBL (2:1 and 3:1) films, 
the N (1s) spectra can be deconvoluted into 2 sets of peaks, each 
corresponding to their constituents (Figure 2e and Figure S11, 
Supporting Information). The compositions for the individual 
sulfur-rich PBBTL and sulfur-deficient BBL polymers are close 
to the theoretical chemical formulae (Figure S11 and Table S2,  
Supporting Information). We further employed depth profiling 
XPS to determine the depth composition of the BHJ blend 
films based on the change in S/O atomic ratios (Figures S12  
and S13, Table S3, Supporting Information). In the blend 
films, more n-type BBL phase was found at the surface as well 
as near the substrate. Both PBBTL and BBL were found to be 
distributed evenly in the bulk film (Figure S12, Supporting 
Information). We further evaluated the molecular packing of 
PBBTL:BBL films using grazing-incidence wide-angle X-ray 
scattering (GIWAXS) (Figure  2f,g). The pristine PBBTL film 
showed largely face-on packing at qz  = 1.87 Å−1 (d-spacing  
= 3.36 Å) with a broad distribution of molecular orientations 
(i.e., qz  = 1.02 Å−1, qxy  = 1.02 Å−1, and qxy  = 1.86 Å−1, respec-
tively). The pristine BBL film showed a predominant edge-on 
orientation, having a strong π–π stacking peak at qxy = 1.80 Å−1  
(d-spacing = 3.49 Å) and a strong lamellar peak at qz = 0.75 Å−1  
(d-spacing = 8.37 Å) with a broad face-on diffraction centered 
at qz  = 1.71 Å−1 (d-spacing = 3.67 Å), in line with previous 
reports.[2,19,38] For the blend PBBTL:BBL (3:1), a lamellar diffrac-
tion peak arises at qz = 0.91 Å−1 (d-spacing = 6.90 Å) and the 
diffraction around qxy = 1.00 Å−1 (d-spacing = 6.28 Å) abate, with 
strong two π–π stacking peak at qz = 1.85 Å−1(d-spacing = 3.39 Å)  
and qxy = 1.86 Å−1 (d-spacing = 3.38 Å), respectively. The reten-
tion of the q-spacings associated with the lamellar stacks of the 
individual species suggests that PBBTL and BBL form relatively 
pure nanosized domains whose stacking is unchanged from 
the neat constituents (Figure 2h). This formation of non-inter-
fering crystallites enables efficient transport for both holes and 
electrons in the BHJ structure. The atomic force microscopy 
images, which showed granular morphology and no distinct 
phase segregation (Figure S14, Supporting Information), fur-
ther indicate relatively uniform distribution between these two 
polymeric phases.
The typical transfer and output characteristics operated 
as either p- or n-channel of the BHJ OECTs are presented in 
Figure 3a,b and Figure S15 (Supporting Information). The 
PBBTL:BBL-based BHJ OECT presents good electrochemical 
doping as both p- and n-channels separately. When the channel 
was used as p-type transistor (upon application of a constant 
source–drain bias of VDS = −0.3 V), a relatively high drain cur-
rent was observed at low VGS, which is mainly attributed to the 
n-doping of BBL component. This is because, at VDS = −0.3 and 
VGS  = 0V, there exists a potential between gate and drain 
electrodes of VGD = 0.3 V (which is larger than the threshold

Supporting Information) and VDS = −0.3 V, as a result, Na+ ions 
from electrolyte was injected into the channel (near the drain 
electrode) and thus doping the BBL phase (leading to elec-
tron accumulated near the drain electrode). As the gate bias 
increased (i.e., VGS increased from 0 to −0.3 V), anions (Cl−) 
from the electrolyte were injected into the heterojunc-
tion channel, starting the electrochemical doping of PBBTL  
component, allowing hole accumulation near the source ter-
minal. Further increasing the gate bias (at VGS − VDS < VT,p), 
VGS and VGD both became negative, anions (Cl−) from the elec-
trolyte were injected into the whole heterojunction channel, 
leading to the hole accumulation in the whole bulk channel 
and hence increased source–drain current (Figure  3b). This 
transfer characteristic behavior indicates that both electrons 
and holes coexist simultaneously in the heterojunction channel

at low gate bias. The formation of non-interfering PBBTL and 
BBL π–π stacking molecular packing allows efficient holes and  
electrons transport. Similarly, as the n-type channel is formed 
(upon application of a constant source–drain bias of VDS = 0.3 V),  
similar electrochemical doping behaviors were seen (Figure 3b).
The detailed OECT performance at various ratios of 
PBBTL:BBL are summarized in Figure 3c, Figure S15 and Table S4

respectively. The pristine BBL devices were found to out-
perform the p-type PBBTL-based devices, exhibiting great 
n-type performance with normalized gm and µC* values of  
2.98 ± 0.94 S cm−1 and 6.02 ± 1.96 F cm−1 V−1 s−1) respectively 
(Figure S8, Supporting Information). In general, when the 
p-type PBBTL polymer was blended at low BBL concentration 
(for example 10 wt% BBL), the BHJ OECTs exhibited superior 
p-type behavior, with normalized gm values of 0.55 ± 0.19 and

0.16 ± 0.02 S  cm−1, and µC* values of 3.04 ± 1.25 and  
0.59 ± 0.06 F cm−1 V−1 s−1, for p-type and n-type, respectively. Upon 
further increasing of the BBL content, the p-type OECT perfor-
mance reduced gradually – reaching a normalized gm value of 
0.05 ± 0.03 S cm−1 and µC* value of 0.36 ± 0.16 F cm−1 V−1 s−1 with 
the higher n-type performance (having a normalized gm value 
of 1.54 ± 0.41 S cm−1 and µC* value of 5.01 ± 0.88 F cm−1 V−1 s−1  
at the content of 66.6 wt% of BBL. Upon blending at the 
ratio of PBBTL:BBL = 3:1, we note that the ambipolar OECTs 
exhibit comparable normalized gm values of 0.41 ± 0.17 and  
0.43 ± 0.24 S  cm−1 and µC* values of 2.72 ± 1.04 and  
1.36 ± 0.81 F cm−1 V−1 s−1 for p-type and n-type, respectively, con-
sistent with the formation of optimized phase separation and 
morphology for both ionic and electronic transport. The bal-
anced drain current and µC* values for p- and n-type in this het-
erojunction OECT, therefore, make it a promising material for 
ambipolar inverters or comprehensive logic circuits. The C* of 
the optimized blend films was also determined independently 
using EIS (Figures S17–S19, Supporting Information), where 
the maximum C* values for n-type and p-type were 168 F cm−3  
and 124 F cm−3, respectively, indicative of good storage capacity 
for both cations and anions. The hole and electron mobility for 
the BHJ OECTs (PBBTL:BBL = 3:1) were then determined to 
be 0.022 ± 0.008 and 0.008 ± 0.005 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively, 
using equation  (1). With higher BBL content of 33.3 wt%  
(PBBTL:BLL = 2:1), the obtained n-type C* value increased fur-
ther to 222 F cm−3 but with reduced p-type C* value of 103 F cm−3, 
which implied that the anions or cation storage capacity of the 
BHJ can be tuned by the component of corresponding p- and 
n-type polymers.
Furthermore, the OECTs using the optimized blends of 
PBBTL:BBL = 3:1 showed good transient speeds of 3.05 ms and 
1.72 ms as p-type and n-type channels, respectively (Figure 3d). 
As presented in Figure  3e, no significant drain current deg-
radation was seen with the channel operated as either p- or 
n-channel, in which the p- and n-channel maintained ≈90% 
and 100% of their initially doped drain current after 5000 cycles 
of pulse measurement, indicating a good reversible electro-
chemical redox process.
The electrochemical doping process either doped with cat-
ions or anions was further explained by the absorption spec-
trum changes under progressive increment of bias (either 
from 0 to 0.8 V or from 0 to −0.6 V, at a step of −0.025 V, see 
Figure  3f,g and Figure S18, Supporting Information), using 
in situ UV–vis spectrum. A similar electrochemical doping 
process was observed when this hybrid film was doped with 
Cl− anions compared with pristine PBBTL film (Figure S6, 
Supporting Information). The result implies that the incorpo-
ration of BBL polymer did not impede the p-doping behavior 
of PBBTL polymer. Meanwhile, progressive increment of the 
bias from 0 to −0.6 V (Figure 3g and Figure S20, Supporting 
Information), cations (Na+) from the electrolyte were injected 
into the BBL film, and the transition peaks centered at 400 and 
578 nm gradually disappeared while two new broad absorption 
features emerged ≈720 nm and 815 nm (ascribed to polaronic 
transition), indicating that the BBL film was switched from 
neutral to reduced state (BBL−) and was to undergo charge 
accumulation. A similar n-doping process was also observed 
in the pristine BBL film (Figure S21, Supporting Information). 
The recorded in situ UV–vis spectrum results imply that the 
donor–acceptor polymer BHJ can be effectively p- or n-doped 
by corresponding ions. The interesting characteristics of the 
BHJ PBBTL:BBL films, motivate further investigation into its 
nanostructure since the nanostructure of the active channel is 
obviously crucial for the ion–electron transport and hence the 
device performance.[9] High-angle annular dark-field scanning 
transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM) images 
reveal a porous fibrillar network for pristine PBBTL, BBL, and 
BHJ PBBTL:BBL films (Figure  3h). Such porous fibrillar net-
work allows rapid penetration and transport of both cations and 
anions in the bulk film and thus enabling fast transient speed 
and good electrochemical doping efficiency. It further empha-
sizes the importance of structure (e.g., porous structures) for 
ion penetration and transport in the bulk channel, and thus the 
device performance.
Next, we investigated the feasibility of using this PBBTL:BBL 
(3:1) BHJ as both pull-up and pull-down channels in a com-
plementary logic circuit (Figure 4a). As presented earlier in 
Figure 3b, the observed comparable drain current in the p- and 
n-type channels indicates balanced electron and hole transport 
to ensure high-performance logic circuits. The voltage transfer 
characteristics of the inverter were presented in Figure  4b–e, 
yielding a high voltage gain value of 42 V V−1 (at VDD = −0.6 V) 
and 31 V V−1 (at VDD = 0.6 V). It is worth noting that this ambi-
polar inverter is capable to process three bits of information  
(“0”, “+1”, and “−1”), due to the ambipolar feature of our BHJ 
OECTs (Figure 3). We further developed a NAND gate logic cir-
cuit (Figure 4f) employing this BHJ channel which exhibited good 
switching behavior (Figure  4g). Owing to the single-processing 
feature of this BHJ blend, the NAND devices can also be prepared 
on the same substrate. Overall, the successful demonstration of 
the inverter and NAND gate logic circuits using our BHJ OECTs 
presents great potential to reduce the fabrication complexity and 
manufacturing costs for future industrial applications.
2.3. Bulk-Heterojunction OECTs Complementary  
Inverter as Voltage Amplifier
Low-cost, high amplification, and low power consumption are 
all crucial features of next-generation biomedical devices. The 
OECT inverter possesses high-voltage amplification capability, 
thus it can monitor and amplify electrophysiological signals 
even at very low input potential while maintaining low power 
consumption due to its low operating voltage (<1 V), making it 
ideal for electrophysiological signal processing (i.e., signal detec-
tion or amplification). While such signal amplification can also 
be achieved using traditional load resistors to provide voltage-
to-voltage amplification, they typically exhibit higher power dis-
sipation or generate additional thermal noise. The introduction 
of BHJ OECTs complementary inverter as voltage amplifiers can 
minimize these issues and provide a simpler fabrication pro-
cess. We, therefore, explore the feasibility of using this inverter 
to amplify electrooculography (EOG) signals. Two 3M elec-
trodes were attached on the left and right sides of the eye—one  
electrode was connected to the Ag/AgCl gate of inverter and 
the other was connected to a voltage supply (Figure 5a,c). The 
potential variations (VEOG) produced by eye movements along

horizontal (left-to-right) or vertical (up-to-down) directions are 
weak (in the millivolt range, ≈1.5 mV).[39] The EOG signals 
were recorded at an offset bias where the peak gain occurs, 
with a constant VDD of −0.6 V. As the eye moves from left to 
right, the inverter picks up an output voltage change of ≈80mV 
(Figure 5b). It is worth mentioning that this BHJ inverter can 
collect signals at different blink speeds, up to 1 Hz (Figure S22, 
Supporting Information). We also tested the corresponding 
signal changes during vertical eye movement, also showing an 
amplified voltage change of ≈80 mV (Figure  5d). Overall, this 
BHJ complementary inverter shows outstanding performance 
in tracking eye movement, further highlighting its great poten-
tial as a signal amplifier in wearable integrated systems.
3. Conclusion
All-polymer BHJ OECTs with ambipolar property were dem-
onstrated, and it provides a facile strategy to simplify the fab-
rication process and reduce the manufacturing cost while 
simultaneously obtaining high performing logic circuits, 
including inverter and NAND gates. This was enabled by the 
development of a new ladder-type, side chain free p-type conju-
gated polymer. The all ladder-type polymer BHJ also proved that 
side chains are not necessary for good ion transport. Instead, 
the polymer nanostructures play a critical role in the ion pen-
etration and transportation and thus the device performance. 
Our work opens a new approach in designing new materials for 
OECTs and will contribute to the development of heterojunction 
ambipolar OECTs toward high performing logic circuits.
4. Experimental Section
Material Preparation: The p-type ladder conjugated polymer, 
6H-pyrrolo[3,2-b:4,5-b’]bis[1,4]benzothiazine 
ladder 
(PTBBL), 
was 
synthesized following the previous report.[29] Sodium chloride (NaCl) 
and methanesulfonic acid (MSA) were all obtained from Sigma-Aldrich. 
The dichloro-p-cyclophane (DPX-C) was purchased from Specialty 
Coating Systems, Inc. The p-Si/SiO2 (300 nm) wafer was provided by 
Maideli Advanced Material Co., Ltd.
OECTs and Inverter Fabrications: Devices were fabricated using a 
previously described Parylene-C peel-off procedure.[9] Source/drain 
electrodes were photolithographically patterned through a lift-off 
process. AZ5214 photoresist was spin-coated on the pre-cleaned 
substrate at 4000 rpm, followed by softbaked at 110 °C for 180 s before 
exposed to UV light (405 nm, 1.2 s) using SUSS MJB4 Mask Aligner 
under a shadow mask, after that, baked at 110 °C for 180 s before flood 
expored of 15 s, finally developed by AZ developer. A thin adhesion layer 
of titanium (5 nm) followed by one layer of Au (50 nm) layer was then 
deposited on the substrate via e-beam evaporation, and subsequently 
immersed the substrates in acetone with sonication for 5 min. Next, a 
layer of 2 µm-thick Parylene C was deposited on the substrates acted 
as an insulating layer to avoid direct contact between electrolyte and 
metal electrodes using SCS Labcoater. At the same time, to improve 
the adhesion between Parylene C and the substrate, 3 droplets 
3-(trimethoxysilyl)propyl methacrylate (A-174 silane) were added to the 
evaporation chamber. To facilitate the subsequently peeling process, 
an anti-adhesion layer of dilute cleaner (Micro-90, 10 wt% in deionized 
(DI)  water) was spin-coated on the substrate before depositing the 
second Parylene-C layer (≈2.5 µm, acting as a sacrificial layer). A  
12 µm-thick AZ P4620 photoresist was subsequently spin-coated onto 
the substrate, soft-baked at 110 °C for 180 s, exposed using SUSS MJB4 
mask aligner, and developed by AZ developer. The patterned channel 
area and contact pads were etched via reactive ion etching (Oxford 
Plasmalab80) at 50 sccm O2, 10 sccm CHF3, 160 W operating conditions. 
PBBTL and BBL solutions were prepared as followed: different ratios of 
PBBTL and BBL polymers were first dissolved in MSA, and stirred for 3 h 
at 60 °C. The mixed solutions were spin-coated on top of the patterned 
substrates to form the channels, followed by immersion in IPA solution 
for 20 min to remove the residual MSA solvent. The second sacrificed 
Parylene-C layer was peeled off, after that, the devices were transferred 
into glove box and annealed at 200  °C for 1 h. The devices used for 
ambipolar OECTs, inverter, NAND, and EOG measurements have a 
channel width/length = 100 µm/5 µm, thickness d = 106 ± 14 nm unless 
otherwise specified.
Electrical characterization: The I–V characteristics of the films and all 
the OECT device characteristics including output and transfer curves 
and pulse measurement were measured under ambient conditions 
using Keysight precision source/measure unit (B2912A). The threshold 
voltage and µC* product of all OECTs were extracted from a fit of the 
linear portion of the 
DI  vs VG curves.[40,41]
Materials Characterization: The thickness of the polymer films was 
characterized with Alpha-Step profilemeter (KLA-Tencor). Absorption 
spectra of the polymer films (≈100 nm) on ITO glass substrate were 
recorded using UV–VIS spectrophotometer (UV-3600, Shimadzu).  
A 2 nm Au layer was deposited on ITO by thermal evaporator at 0.1 A s−1 
to improve the adhesion of films before depositing the polymer films. 
In situ spectraelectrochemistry measurement were subsequently carried 
out under a constant offset bias range from 0 V to −0.6 V for BBL, 0 
to 0.8 V for PBBTL, and 0 to −0.6 V or 0 to 0.8 V for PBBTL:BBL films 
vs Ag/AgCl electrode, operated in 0.1 m NaCl aqueous electrolyte. The 
absorption spectra were recorded over the wavelength range from 300 to 
900 nm as films were biased.
Cyclic voltammetry (CV) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy 
(EIS) were carried out using Metrohm Autolab potentiostat with a three-
terminal setup (composed of a working electrode, a Pt counter electrode, 
and an Ag/AgCl reference electrode), operated in 0.1 m NaCl aqueous 
electrolyte. CV measurement was carried out between 0 V to 0.8 V for 
PBBTL and −0.6 V to 0.8 V for PBBTL:BBL vs AgAgCl electrode. For the 
CV measurement, the films were deposited on ITO substrates used as 
working electrodes. The volumetric capacitance of PBBTL, BBL, and the 
PBBTL:BBL films were extracted from EIS. For the EIS measurement, 
the films were deposited on a pre-patterned Ti/Au electrode, with 2 
µm-thick Parylene C as the insulating layer to prevent direct exposure 
between electrolyte and metal electrode, the preparation procedure 
was as same as described above for OECTs fabrication, and acted as 
the working electrode. EIS was performed over a frequency range from 
104 Hz and 10−1 Hz, with a 10 mV single sinusoidal signal over a DC 
offset bias between 0 to 0.8 V for PBBTL, 0 to 0.6 V for BBL, and −0.6 to  
0.8 V for BHJ films. The obtained impedance data were fit to an 
equivalent circuit of Rs(Rp||C), where Rs is the electrolyte resistance,  
Rp is the charge transfer resistance, and C is the capacitance. The 
volumetric capacitance C*  = C/V), where V is the volume of the 
deposited film.
X-ray 
Photoelectron 
Spectroscopy 
(XPS): 
X-ray 
photoelectron 
spectroscopy (XPS) was employed to reveal the presence and 
distribution of both PBBTL and BBL chains in the bulk film. A 2-nm Au 
layer was deposited on p-Si/SiO2 substrates to improve the adhesion 
of films before depositing the polymer films. For the blend PBBTL:BBL 
film, the N (1s) spectra could be deconvoluted into 2 sets of peaks, 
each corresponding to their constituents. The peak area from the peak-
fitted N (1s) spectra was summed for the respective components and 
normalized based on the number of N atoms in each compound, hence, 
the normalized peak area could represent the amount of the component 
in the blend. The fitting was used as the basis to determine the ratio of 
both components. The fitting was done by keeping constraints for the 
peaks from the same set. The HOMO of PBBTL and BBL was determined 
by ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) measurement. The 
LUMO of BBL can be approximated by

absorption peak from a film-state UV–Vis spectra and 0.3 eV is the 
exciton binding energy.[42]
Grazing-Incidence Wide-Angle X-ray Diffraction (GIWAXS): GIWAXS 
was performed on the Complex Materials Scatterign (CMS) beamline 
of the National Synchrotron Light Source II (NSLS-II), Brookhaven 
National Lab. An X-ray beam with an energy of 13.5 keV shone upon 
the samples with an incidence angle of 0.1°, to explore the molecular 
packing of PBBTL, BBL, and the PBBTL:BBL films. A custom-made 
Pilatus-800K detector was placed at distance of 257 mm from the 
sample to capture 2D-GIWAXS images with an exposure time of 10 s. All 
2D-GIWAXS images had been background subtracted. A 50 nm Au layer 
was deposited on Si/SiO2 by thermal evaporator at 0.1 A s−1 to improve 
the adhesion of the films before depositing the polymers.
Scanning Transmission Electron Microscopy (STEM): 10 mg  mL−1 
PBBTL:BBL dissolved in methanesulfonic acid was spin-coated onto a 
pre-cleaned Si wafer. The Si wafer was immersed in DI water and the 
films were exfoliated from the Si wafer substrate. TEM copper grid 
coated with lacey carbon membrane was used to scoop the floating film. 
The films on TEM copper grids were annealed at 100 °C on a hotplate 
to remove the residual water. The BBL films on TEM copper grids were 
brought into a N2 glovebox (O2 and H2O <1 ppm) and further annealed 
at 200 °C for 1 h. The annealed films were then allowed to cool down to 
room temperature. The TEM study of the as-obtained films on a copper 
grid was conducted on an FEI Titan 80/300 (S)TEM with an acceleration 
voltage of 200 kV. The film was stable under electron beams without any 
visible degradation of crystalline structures. Atomic force microscopy 
(Cypher S) was employed to check the morphology of the polymer films 
on Si/SiO2 substrates in tapping mode.
Electrooculography (EOG) Monitoring: For the EOG monitoring of eye 
motion, a 33-year-old healthy male participated in the experiments. The BHJ 
ambipolar inverter was used as an analog voltage preamplifier for recording 
the EOG signals. In brief, two adhesive 3M dot electrodes (Red Dot, Model 
2239) were either placed on the left and right sides or up and down sides 
of the eye, with one end connected to the Ag/AgCl gate of inverter and 
the other end connected to a voltage supply (Agilent B1500). Note that 
the BHJ OECT device was located near the human subject and measured 
in a probe station during the EOG testing. Before the experiments, the 
participant was trained on a protocol that included horizontal and vertical 
eye movements. All EOG measurements were approved by the Institutional 
Review Board (approval number: IRB-2022-102), and informed written 
consent was obtained prior to subject participation.
Statistical Analysis: Data presented were representative of at least  
3 independent experiments, and quantitative results were expressed as 
mean ± standard deviation (SD) unless otherwise specified.
